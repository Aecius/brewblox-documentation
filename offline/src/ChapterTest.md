# This part of the document is generated entirely in a seperate markdown file.

It's called ChapterTest and has HTML enabled.

# Title

# This is a title too, but it has to be indented under `:markdown-it`

## As is this

### And this

  <figure class = "block">
    <h1> NOTICE!</h1>
    <p> This is a NOTICE or WARNING block. It is made in HTML. Note that its class is defined in the HTML since Markdown does not support Classes Natively, but it does support HTML </p> 
  </figure>

The format for a text can be seen here. starts the paragraph, the text immediately follows
It automatically adds a white space
Sadly this no longer works: Sometimes you just need an indented text for clarity. For that we use p. followed by indented text.

## Subheaders can also be added

### and paragraph headers

and so things go on and on and on and on.
yermum.

  <figure class = "block">
    <h1> notice </h1>
    <p>This is a notice. It is here to notify you of something you should notice. Not following this notice will not harm you. It might not even break anything. But it will definitely inconvenience you. You don't want to be inconvenienced, do you now? </p>
</figure>
